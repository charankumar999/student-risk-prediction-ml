# 🎓 Student Academic Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a student is at academic risk (0 or 1) using machine learning.
The prediction is based on factors such as attendance, marks, study hours, and sleep duration.

It demonstrates a complete beginner-friendly ML workflow including:
- Data loading
- Feature selection
- Model training
- Evaluation
- Prediction on new data
